container : Tailwind’s container class gives your content a maximum width depending on the screen size.

mx-auto : m = margin, x = horizontal (left + right), auto = automatic. So it sets margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;. This centers the whole container horizontally in the page.

p-4 : p = padding (inside spacing). 4 = Tailwind spacing unit → by default, 1rem (16px). So p-4 means padding: 1rem; on all sides (top, right, bottom, left).

grid : Turns the inner div into a CSS Grid container. That means its children (items.map(...)) become grid items. Grid lets us control rows, columns, and gaps easily.

grid-cols-4 :Defines how many columns the grid should have. grid-cols-4 → exactly 4 equal-width columns.

Żgp-4 : Adds space between grid items (both rows and columns). gap-4 = 1rem (16px) of space.

border : Adds a 1px border around the card. Default color is a light gray (you can change later with border-gray-300 etc.).

rounded-lg Rounds the corners of the card. lg = large radius → smoother corners. You could use rounded-md (medium), rounded-xl (extra large), etc.

flex flex-col : Turns the card into a flexbox container. flex-col → stacks child elements vertically (image on top, name/price in middle, button at bottom).

flex-shrink-0 means: “don’t allow this item to shrink smaller than its natural size.”

cursor-pointer : Changes the mouse cursor to a hand (pointer) when hovering over the element.

transition-all : Enables CSS transitions for all properties (colors, shadows, transforms, etc.).

duration-300 : Controls how long the transition takes.

hover:scale-102 : Scales the element to 102% of its original size when hovered.

hover:border-purple-400/40 : Changes the border color on hover.
